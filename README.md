### Hi there üëã

The name is Yuan "Luke" Songwei, also known as "1MLightyears"(or Lightyears), a free, independent coder likes to write something fun!<br>
I can speak zh-cn, en, ja.<br>
Main developing language is Python & JavaScript, but I can also code in lua & C/++ & Java & Pascal.<br>
Now I'm interested in developing pipelines with Python, including ML/AI, data gathering/mining/analyzing, etc.<br>
I have experience of High Performance Computing(HPC) & Cluster File System & Distributed File System and experience of web development.
As a pre-OIer, I'm also interested in math and algorithms.<br>
